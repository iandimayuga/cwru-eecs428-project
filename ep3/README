EECS 428 Episode 3

I have corrected the elephant file size to be 400MB as specified.
I have also corrected the Browser class to have two nodes, a source and a sink, each independently connected to the regional router.
The test results are very similar, but the elephant finishing times have changed.

Elephant 1: 704s
Elephant 2: 885s
Elephant 3: 1441s
