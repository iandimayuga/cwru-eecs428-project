EECS 428 Episode 2

I have included the nam trace as well as the output from my tests.

According to the tests, the mean exponential burst time is 156 seconds, which is roughly close to 180.
I cannot find a specific reason for the 24-second disparity, and the exponential burst time is specified in one line of code, so I accept the result.

The exponential idle time is 60 seconds as expected.

The only packets that are not 1500B were syns and acks.

The majority of acks were sent immediately, and the next greatest number of acks were sent exactly 50ms after the data they acknowledge.
This indicates that the DelAck timeout I configured to be 50ms was firing at that time.
There were several acks that did not conform to these categories, but the number is negligible and is likely due to retransmissions.

The TCP packet to ack ratio is 1.97, which indicates that every other packet was acknowledged.

Finally, the Elephant stopping times are very similar to Episode 1's stopping times:

Elephant 1: 663s
Elephant 2: 829s
Elephant 3: 1397s
